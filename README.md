### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Jason**](https://jeffco.dev), a web developer.

I enjoy working across the stack to build fast, accessible, and reliable web applications.  
I care about clean architecture, well-structured code, and delivering polished interfaces that feel intuitive.

Driven by precision and consistency, I’m always focused on writing maintainable code and following best development practices.

#### What I like working on:
* Fast, accessible UIs  
* Clean, modular architecture  
* Improving code readability and structure
